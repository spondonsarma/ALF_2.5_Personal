# General  finite temperature auxiliary field code #

## General information ##
Last version of the code is in Prog_8

Last version of the analysis files is in Analysis_8

1)    Implemented  optimizations made by Johannes.  The code is thereby not necessarily faster !  You  may want to  try the code with the  original routines upgrade_FFA.f90  Operator_FFA.f90. You will find them in the directory Prog_8/FFA_Originals

2)    In the file parameter you can read in a  variable  CPU_MAX in the namespace &VAR_QMC. If present the code will carry out as many bins as allowed in the given amount of time.   If not present the code will just react as usual and carry out the requested number of bins. (Implemented by Martin  Bercx). 

3)    In this version,  NWRAP does not have to be a multiple of Ltrot.  This greatly facilitates temperature scans. 

4)    I have included the Kondo model on the honeycomb lattice with z-frustrating interactions.
