!> ! This constructs a decompostion Mat = Q D R P^* using a pivoted QR decomposition
!
!> @param Ndim[in] The size of the involved matrices
!> @param Mat[inout] The matrix that we want to decompose. The Householder reflectors and the upper
!>            triangular matrix are returned in Mat on exit
!> @param D[inout] The diagonal elements
!> @param IPVT[inout] A Pivoting vector that collects the permutations. Can be used by ?LAPMR and ?LAPMT
!> @param TAU[inout] The scalar factors for the Householder decomposition
!> @param WORK[inout] work memory. We query and allocate it in this routine. Needs to be deallocated outside.
!> @param LWORK[inout] optimal size of the work memory.
