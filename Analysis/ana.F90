!> @brief 
!> Wrapper program for analyzing Monte Carlo bins.
!> 
!> @details
!>  Analyzes scalar observables, equal-time and timedisplaced correlation functions.
!>
!>  Hand over any number of file names as command line argumens to this program.
!>  If will analyze names ending in "_scal" as scalar observables, "_eq"  asequal-time 
!>  correlation functions and "_tau" as timedisplaced correlation functions.
!>
!>  For timedisplaced observables that are listen in "names_PH" in namelist "VAR_PH_names"
!>  in file "parameters", it is assumed that they are symmetric in imaginary time around tau = beta/2
