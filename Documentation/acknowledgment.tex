MB thanks the the Bavarian Competence Network for Technical and Scientific High Performance Computing (KONWIHR) for financial support. FG  and JH thank the SFB-1170 for  financial support under projects Z03 and C01.  FFA thanks the DFG-funded FOR1807 and FOR1346 for partial financial support.
Part of the optimization of the code was carried during  the  Porting and Tuning Workshop 2016 offered by the Forschungszentrum J\"ulich.
Calculations  to extensively test this package were carried out on SuperMUC at the  Leibniz Supercomputing Centre and on  JURECA \cite{Jureca16} at the J\"ulich Supercomputing Centre (JSC). We thank those institutions for generous computer allocations.
