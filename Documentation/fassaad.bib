@article{Liu18,
	Abstract = {The discovery of quantum spin-Hall (QSH) insulators has brought topology to the forefront of condensed matter physics. While a QSH state from spin-orbit coupling can be fully understood in terms of band theory, fascinating many-body effects are expected if it instead results from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we introduce a model of interacting Dirac fermions where a QSH state is dynamically generated. Our tuning parameter further allows us to destabilize the QSH state in favour of a superconducting state through proliferation of charge-2e topological defects. This route to superconductivity put forward by Grover and Senthil is an instance of a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP). Our model offers the possibility to study DQCPs without a second length scale associated with the reduced symmetry between field theory and lattice realization and, by construction, is amenable to large-scale fermion quantum Monte Carlo simulations.},

@article{Kim_rev2013,
	Abstract = { We discuss phenomena arising from the combined influence of electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), with an emphasis on emergent quantum phases and transitions in heavy transition metal compounds with 4d and 5d elements. A common theme is the influence of spin-orbital entanglement produced by SOC, which influences the electronic and magnetic structure. In the weak-to-intermediate correlation regime, we show how nontrivial band-like topology leads to a plethora of phases related to topological insulators (TIs). We expound these ideas using the example of pyrochlore iridates, showing how many novel phases, such as the Weyl semimetal, axion insulator, topological Mott insulator, and TIs, may arise in this context. In the strong correlation regime, we argue that spin-orbital entanglement fully or partially removes orbital degeneracy, reducing or avoiding the normally ubiquitous Jahn-Teller effect. As we illustrate for the honeycomb-lattice iridates and double perovskites, this leads to enhanced quantum fluctuations of the spin-orbital entangled states and the chance to promote exotic spin liquid and multipolar ordered ground states. Connections to experiments, materials, and future directions are discussed. },

@article{Tokura19,
	Abstract = {The importance of global band topology is unequivocally recognized in condensed matter physics, and new states of matter, such as topological insulators, have been discovered. Owing to their bulk band topology, 3D topological insulators possess a massless Dirac dispersion with spin--momentum locking at the surface. Although 3D topological insulators were originally proposed in time-reversal invariant systems, the onset of a spontaneous magnetization or, equivalently, a broken time-reversal symmetry leads to the formation of an exchange gap in the Dirac band dispersion. In such magnetic topological insulators, tuning of the Fermi level in the exchange gap results in the emergence of a quantum Hall effect at zero magnetic field, that is, of a quantum anomalous Hall effect. Here, we review the basic concepts of magnetic topological insulators and their experimental realization, together with the discovery and verification of their emergent properties. In particular, we discuss how the development of tailored materials through heterostructure engineering has made it possible to access the quantum anomalous Hall effect, the topological magnetoelectric effect, the physics related to the chiral edge states that appear in these materials and various spintronic phenomena. Further theoretical and experimental research on magnetic topological insulators will provide fertile ground for the development of new concepts for next-generation electronic devices for applications such as spintronics with low energy consumption, dissipationless topological electronics and topological quantum computation.},

	Abstract = {By performing high resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments on four different families of p-type cuprates, over an energy range much bigger than investigated before, we report the discovery of a universal high energy anomaly in the spectral function. This anomaly is characterized by the presence of two new high energy scales E1=0.35--0.45eV and E2=0.8--0.9eV and the pinning of the main ARPES spectral function along the boundary of a diamond in the momentum space. This anomaly unveils a missing link between the doped oxygen holes and the quasiparticles, providing a full range of relevant interactions to the high Tc problem.},

@article{Moritz10,
	Abstract = {Recently, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy has been used to highlight an anomalously large band renormalization at high binding energies in cuprate superconductors: the high energy ``waterfall'' or high energy anomaly (HEA). The anomaly is present for both hole- and electron-doped cuprates as well as the half-filled parent insulators with different energy scales arising on either side of the phase diagram. While photoemission matrix elements clearly play a role in changing the aesthetic appearance of the band dispersion, i.e. creating a ``waterfall''-like appearance, they provide an inadequate description for the physics that underlies the strong band renormalization giving rise to the HEA. Model calculations of the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian showcase the role played by correlations in the formation of the HEA and uncover significant differences in the HEA energy scale for hole- and electron-doped cuprates. In addition, this approach properly captures the transfer of spectral weight accompanying doping in a correlated material and provides a unifying description of the HEA across both sides of the cuprate phase diagram. We find that the anomaly demarcates a transition, or cross-over, from a quasiparticle band at low binding energies near the Fermi level to valence bands at higher binding energy, assumed to be of strong oxygen character.},

This state is predicted to become massive if time reversal symmetry is broken, and to become insulating if the Fermi energy is positioned inside both the surface and bulk gaps. We introduced magnetic dopants into the three-dimensional topological insulator dibismuth triselenide (Bi2Se3) to break the time reversal symmetry and further position the Fermi energy inside the gaps by simultaneous magnetic and charge doping. The resulting insulating massive Dirac fermion state, which we observed by angle-resolved photoemission, paves the way for studying a range of topological phenomena relevant to both condensed matter and particle physics.},

We show theoretically that an electric charge near a topological surface state induces an image magnetic monopole charge due to the topological magneto-electric effect. The magnetic field generated by the image magnetic monopole may be experimentally measured, and the inverse square law of the field dependence can be determined quantitatively. We propose that this effect can be used to experimentally realize a gas of quantum particles carrying fractional statistics, consisting of the bound states of the electric charge and the image magnetic monopole charge.},

	Abstract = {A microscopic understanding of the strongly correlated physics of the cuprates must account for the translational and rotational symmetry breaking that is present across all cuprate families, commonly in the form of stripes. Here we investigate emergence of stripes in the Hubbard model, a minimal model believed to be relevant to the cuprate superconductors, using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations at finite temperatures and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) ground state calculations. By varying temperature, doping, and model parameters, we characterize the extent of stripes throughout the phase diagram of the Hubbard model. Our results show that including the often neglected next-nearest-neighbor hopping leads to the absence of spin incommensurability upon electron-doping and nearly half-filled stripes upon hole-doping. The similarities of these findings to experimental results on both electron and hole-doped cuprate families support a unified description across a large portion of the cuprate phase diagram.},

We ask whether the basic mechanism for the transformation involves electron diffraction off a quantum critical spin-density wave, or whether a breakdown in the composite nature of the heavy electron takes place at the quantum critical point. We show that the Hall constant changes continuously in the first scenario, but may `jump' discontinuously at a quantum critical point where the composite character of the electron quasiparticles changes.},

	Abstract = {The observation of a separation between the antiferromagnetic phase boundary and the small-large Fermi surface transition in recent experiments has led to the proposal that frustration is an important additional tuning parameter in the Kondo lattice model of heavy fermion materials. The introduction of a Kondo (K) and a frustration (Q) axis into the phase diagram permits us to discuss the physics of heavy fermion materials in a broader perspective. The current experimental situation is analyzed in the context of this combined ``QK'' phase diagram. We discuss various theoretical models for the frustrated Kondo lattice, using general arguments to characterize the nature of the f-electron localization transition that occurs between the spin liquid and heavy Fermi liquid ground-states. We concentrate in particular on the Shastry--Sutherland Kondo lattice model, for which we establish the qualitative phase diagram using strong coupling arguments and the large-N expansion. The paper closes with some brief remarks on promising future theoretical directions.},

	Abstract = {The screening of an impurity spin by conduction electrons is associated with the formation of a large Kondo screening cloud, of size ξ K . We study the quantum entanglement between a region of size r surrounding the impurity and the rest of the sample (of total size R ) using density matrix renormalization group and analytic methods. The corresponding 'impurity entanglement entropy', S imp , is shown to be a universal scaling function of r /ξ K and r / R . We calculate this universal function using Fermi liquid theory in the regime ξ K ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ll.gif] {ll} r .},

@article{Lai17,
	Abstract = {While electronic states with nontrivial topology have traditionally been known in insulators, they have been evidenced in metals during the past 2 years. Such Weyl semimetals show topological protection while conducting electricity both in the bulk and on the surface. An outstanding question is whether topological protection can happen in metals with strong correlations. Here, we report theoretical work on a strongly correlated lattice model to demonstrate the emergence of a Weyl{\textendash}Kondo semimetal. We identify Weyl fermions in the bulk and Fermi arcs on the surface, both of which are associated with the many-body phenomenon called the Kondo effect. We determine a key signature of this Weyl{\textendash}Kondo semimetal, which is realized in a recently discovered heavy-fermion compound.Insulating states can be topologically nontrivial, a well-established notion that is exemplified by the quantum Hall effect and topological insulators. By contrast, topological metals have not been experimentally evidenced until recently. In systems with strong correlations, they have yet to be identified. Heavy-fermion semimetals are a prototype of strongly correlated systems and, given their strong spin-orbit coupling, present a natural setting to make progress. Here, we advance a Weyl{\textendash}Kondo semimetal phase in a periodic Anderson model on a noncentrosymmetric lattice. The quasiparticles near the Weyl nodes develop out of the Kondo effect, as do the surface states that feature Fermi arcs. We determine the key signatures of this phase, which are realized in the heavy-fermion semimetal Ce3Bi4Pd3. Our findings provide the much-needed theoretical foundation for the experimental search of topological metals with strong correlations and open up an avenue for systematic studies of such quantum phases that naturally entangle multiple degrees of freedom.},

	Abstract = {Quantum spin Hall materials hold the promise of revolutionary devices with dissipationless spin currents, but have required cryogenic temperatures owing to small energy gaps. Here we show theoretically that a room-temperature regime with a large energy gap may be achievable within a paradigm that exploits the atomic spin-orbit coupling. The concept is based on a substrate-supported monolayer of a high-Z element, and is experimentally realized as a bismuth honeycomb lattice on top of the insulator SiC(0001). Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we detect a gap of ~0.8 eV and conductive edge states consistent with theory. Our combined theoretical and experimental results demonstrate a concept for a quantum spin Hall wide-gap scenario, where the chemical potential resides in the global system gap, ensuring robust edge conductance.},

	Abstract = {Universal properties of quantum (zero-temperature) phase transitions are typically well-described by the classical Landau theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. A paradigmatic counterexample is deconfined criticality, where quantum interference allows for a direct and continuous transition between states with distinct symmetry-breaking patterns, a phenomenon that is classically forbidden. In this work, we extend the scope of deconfined criticality to a case where breaking of a global symmetry coincides with confinement of a local (gauge) symmetry. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate a lattice realization of this transition. Remarkably, we uncover emergent and enlarged global and gauge symmetries. These findings direct us in constructing a critical field theory description.We study a model of fermions on the square lattice at half-filling coupled to an Ising gauge theory that was recently shown in Monte Carlo simulations to exhibit Z2 topological order and massless Dirac fermion excitations. On tuning parameters, a confining phase with broken symmetry (an antiferromagnet in one choice of Hamiltonian) was also established, and the transition between these phases was found to be continuous, with coincident onset of symmetry breaking and confinement. While the confinement transition in pure gauge theories is well-understood in terms of condensing magnetic flux excitations, the same transition in the presence of gapless fermions is a challenging problem owing to the statistical interactions between fermions and the condensing flux excitations. The conventional scenario then proceeds via a two-step transition, involving a symmetry-breaking transition leading to gapped fermions followed by confinement. In contrast, here, using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide further evidence for a direct, continuous transition and also find numerical evidence for an enlarged SO(5) symmetry rotating between antiferromagnetism and valence bond solid orders proximate to criticality. Guided by our numerical finding, we develop a field theory description of the direct transition involving an emergent nonabelian [SU(2)] gauge theory and a matrix Higgs field. We contrast our results with the conventional Gross{\textendash}Neveu{\textendash}Yukawa transition.},

@article{Tang17,
	Abstract = {Although graphene is often thought of as a material in which electron-electron interactions are negligible, some of its properties cannot be explained by such a simple picture. Tang et al. undertook comprehensive quantum Monte Carlo numerical calculations that consider both long-range and contact interactions in systems that, like graphene, have two-dimensional (2D) Dirac electrons. Different 2D Dirac materials systems, such as topological insulators and graphene on various substrates, reside in different parts of the resulting phase diagram.Science, this issue p. 570The role of electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional Dirac fermion systems remains enigmatic. Using a combination of nonperturbative numerical and analytical techniques that incorporate both the contact and long-range parts of the Coulomb interaction, we identify the two previously discussed regimes: a Gross-Neveu transition to a strongly correlated Mott insulator and a semimetallic state with a logarithmically diverging Fermi velocity accurately described by the random phase approximation. We predict that experimental realizations of Dirac fermions span this crossover and that this determines whether the Fermi velocity is increased or decreased by interactions. We explain several long-standing mysteries, including why the observed Fermi velocity in graphene is consistently about 20\% larger than values obtained from ab initio calculations and why graphene on different substrates shows different behaviors.},

	Abstract = {We study the properties of the nearest-neighbor SU(N) antiferromagnet a square lattice as a function of N and the number of rows (m) and columns (nc) in the Young tableau of the SU(N) representation on the A sublattice; the sites of the B sublattice have the conjugate representation (the familiar Heisenberg antiferromagnet has N = 2, m = 1 and nc = 2 S). We study the global phase diagram in the (N, m, nc) space using 1N expansions; in particular: (i) for N large with m proportional to N and nc arbitrary, we find spin-Peierls (dimerized) ground states with short-range spin correlations; (ii) with m = 1, the model is shown to be equivalent, at order 1N, to a generalized quantum dimer model. We discuss the relationship of these results to the SU(N) generalization of recent arguments by Haldane on the effect of ``hedgehog'' point singularities in the space-time spin configuration. As an intermediate step in our calculation, we present a simple new derivation of the coherent state path integral representation of SU(N) spin models.},

	Abstract = {Ground states of certain materials can support exotic excitations with a charge equal to a fraction of the fundamental electron charge. The condensation of these fractionalized particles has been predicted to drive unusual quantum phase transitions. Through numerical and theoretical analysis of a physical model of interacting lattice bosons, we establish the existence of such an exotic critical point, called XY*. We measure a highly nonclassical critical exponent η = 1.493 and construct a universal scaling function of winding number distributions that directly demonstrates the distinct topological sectors of an emergent Z2 gauge field. The universal quantities used to establish this exotic transition can be used to detect other fractionalized quantum critical points in future model and material systems.},

Such is the case for Ba3CuSb2O9, which is magnetically anisotropic at the atomic scale but curiously isotropic on mesoscopic length and time scales. We find that the frustration of Wannier{\textquoteright}s Ising model on the triangular lattice is imprinted in a nanostructured honeycomb lattice of Cu2+ ions that resists a coherent static Jahn-Teller distortion. The resulting two-dimensional random-bond spin-1/2 system on the honeycomb lattice has a broad spectrum of spin-dimer{\textendash}like excitations and low-energy spin degrees of freedom that retain overall hexagonal symmetry.},

Various interactions responsible for these effects are discussed: the electron-lattice, quadrupole-quadrupole, and exchange interactions. The mutual effects of the orbital ordering and the magnetic properties of corresponding compounds are discussed. The exchange interaction in the cases of twofold and threefold orbital degeneracy is discussed. The effect of a magnetic field on the orbital and magnetic structure and the temperature dependence of the exchange interaction are studied.

	Abstract = { We discuss designer Hamiltonians---lattice models tailored to be free from sign problems (``de-signed'') when simulated with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods but which still host complex many-body states and quantum phase transitions of interest in condensed matter physics. We focus on quantum spin systems in which competing interactions lead to nonmagnetic ground states. These states and the associated quantum phase transitions can be studied in great detail, enabling direct access to universal properties and connections with low-energy effective quantum field theories. As specific examples, we discuss the transition from a N{\'e}el antiferromagnet to either a uniform quantum paramagnet or a spontaneously symmetry-broken valence-bond solid (VBS) in SU(2) and SU(N) invariant spin models. We also discuss anisotropic (XXZ) systems harboring topological Z2 spin liquids and the XY* transition. We briefly review recent progress on QMC algorithms, including ground-state projection in the valence-bond basis and direct computation of the Renyi variants of the entanglement entropy. },

Results from numerical simulations of the model with N = 1 adjoint flavor on a                   {\$}4^3{\backslash}times8{\$}                 lattice are presented, using both hybrid Monte Carlo and Two-Step Multi-Boson algorithms. It is shown that the sign of the fermion determinant starts to fluctuate once the model enters a phase with non-zero baryon charge density. HMC simulations are not ergodic in this regime, but TSMB simulations retain ergodicity even in the dense phase, and in addition appear to show superior decorrelation. The HMC results for the equation of state and the pion mass show good quantitative agreement with the predictions of chiral perturbation theory, which should hold only for                   {\$}N{\backslash}ge2{\$}                . The TSMB results incorporating the sign of the determinant support a delayed onset transition, consistent with the pattern of symmetry breaking expected for N = 1.},

	Abstract = {A unified theory of quantum critical points beyond the conventional Landau--Ginzburg--Wilson paradigm remains unknown. According to Landau cubic criterion, phase transitions should be first-order when cubic terms of order parameters are allowed by symmetry in the Landau--Ginzburg free energy. Here, from renormalization group analysis, we show that second-order quantum phase transitions can occur at such putatively first-order transitions in interacting two-dimensional Dirac semimetals. As such type of Landau-forbidden quantum critical points are induced by gapless fermions, we call them fermion-induced quantum critical points. We further introduce a microscopic model of SU(N) fermions on the honeycomb lattice featuring a transition between Dirac semimetals and Kekule valence bond solids. Remarkably, our large-scale sign-problem-free Majorana quantum Monte Carlo simulations show convincing evidences of a fermion-induced quantum critical points for N = 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, consistent with the renormalization group analysis. We finally discuss possible experimental realizations of the fermion-induced quantum critical points in graphene and graphene-like materials.},

	Abstract = {The Reversible Jump algorithm is one of the most widely used Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for Bayesian estimation and model selection. A generalized multiple-try version of this algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is based on drawing several proposals at each step and randomly choosing one of them on the basis of weights (selection probabilities) that may be arbitrarily chosen. Among the possible choices, a method is employed which is based on selection probabilities depending on a quadratic approximation of the posterior distribution. Moreover, the implementation of the proposed algorithm for challenging model selection problems, in which the quadratic approximation is not feasible, is considered. The resulting algorithm leads to a gain in efficiency with respect to the Reversible Jump algorithm, and also in terms of computational effort. The performance of this approach is illustrated for real examples involving a logistic regression model and a latent class model.},

	Abstract = {To make the transition from the quasi-long-range order in a chain of antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1/2 spins to the true long-range order that occurs in a plane, one can assemble chains to make ladders of increasing width. Surprisingly, this crossover between one and two dimensions is not at all smooth. Ladders with an even number of legs have purely short-range magnetic order and a finite energy gap to all magnetic excitations. Predictions of this ground state have now been verified experimentally. Holes doped into these ladders are predicted to pair and possibly superconduct.},

@article{Paramekanti07,
	Abstract = {SU ( N ) quantum spin systems may be realized in a variety of physical systems including ultracold atoms in optical lattices. The study of such models also leads to insights into possible novel quantum phases and phase transitions of SU (2) spin models. Here we use Gutzwiller projected fermionic variational wavefunctions to explore the phase diagram and correlation functions of SU ( N ) quantum spin models in the self-conjugate representation. In one dimension, the ground state of the SU (4) spin chain with Heisenberg bilinear and biquadratic interactions is studied by examining instabilities of the Gutzwiller projected free fermion ground state to various broken symmetries. The variational phase diagram so obtained agrees well with exact results. The spin--spin and dimer--dimer correlation functions of the Gutzwiller projected free fermion state with N flavours of fermions are in good agreement with exact and 1/ N calculations for the critical points of SU ( N ) spin chains. In two dimensions, the phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the square lattice is obtained by finding instabilities of the Gutzwiller projected π-flux state. In the absence of biquadratic interactions, the model exhibits long-range N{\'e}el order for N = 2 and 4, and spin Peierls (columnar dimer) order for N >4. Upon including biquadratic interactions in the SU (4) model (with a sign appropriate to a fermionic Hubbard model), the N{\'e}el order diminishes and eventually disappears, giving way to an extended valence bond crystal. In the case of the SU (6) model, the dimerized ground state melts at sufficiently large biquadratic interaction, yielding a projected π-flux spin liquid phase which in turn undergoes a transition into an extended valence bond crystal at even larger biquadratic interaction. The spin correlations of the projected π-flux state at N = 4 are in good agreement with 1/ N calculations. We find that the state shows strongly enhanced dimer correlations, in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. We also compare our results with a recent quantum Monte Carlo study of the SU (4) Heisenberg model.},

@article{Affleck91,
	Abstract = {We investigate a class of isotropic SU(2n) quantum antiferromagnets for which we can find the exact ground states. These models contain nearest-neighbor interactions which are of higher order than the purely bilinear Heisenberg exchange interaction, and can be constructed for antisymmetric, self-conjugate representations of SU(2n) on bipartite lattices of coordination number z if n = mz (where m is an integer). The ground states are doubly degenerate, breaking both lattice-translation (t) and charge-conjugation (C) symmetries, and are emblematic of a new type of magnetic order (distinct from N{\'e}el and spin-Peierls order) unidentified in previous investigations of purely bilinear exchange models. We examine the general SU(4) nearest-neighbor spin chain with bilinear and biquadratic interactions in some detail and delineate the phase diagram. The C-breaking states are separated from dimerized states by a phase transition; a semiclassical mapping to a perturbed Wess-Zumino-Witten model enables us to study this transition. We find the expected integrable point at this transition directly from the Yang-Baxter equations. For two other choices of the ratio of the biquadratic to the bilinear coupling, the hamiltonian exhibits additional SU(6) symmetry and also corresponds to SU(2) spin-52 hamiltonians with fine-tuned parameters.},

	Abstract = {A new definition of order called topological order is proposed for two-dimensional systems in which no long-range order of the conventional type exists. The possibility of a phase transition characterized by a change in the response of the system to an external perturbation is discussed in the context of a mean field type of approximation. The critical behaviour found in this model displays very weak singularities. The application of these ideas to the xy model of magnetism, the solid-liquid transition, and the neutral superfluid are discussed. This type of phase transition cannot occur in a superconductor nor in a Heisenberg ferromagnet.},

	Abstract = {Chirality{$[$}mdash{$]$}or /`handedness{$[$}rsquor{$]$}{$[$}mdash{$]$}is a symmetry property crucial to fields as diverse as biology, chemistry and high-energy physics. In graphene, chiral symmetry emerges naturally as a consequence of the carbon honeycomb lattice. This symmetry can be broken by interactions that couple electrons with opposite momenta in graphene. Here we directly visualize the formation of Kekule bond order, one such phase of broken chiral symmetry, in an ultraflat graphene sheet grown epitaxially on a copper substrate. We show that its origin lies in the interactions between individual vacancies in the copper substrate that are mediated electronically by the graphene. We show that this interaction causes the bonds in graphene to distort, creating a phase with broken chiral symmetry. The Kekule ordering is robust at ambient temperature and atmospheric conditions, indicating that intercalated atoms may be harnessed to drive graphene and other two-dimensional materials towards electronically desirable and exotic collective phases.},

	Abstract = {Paramagnetic heavy fermion insulators consist of fully occupied quasiparticle bands inherent to Fermi liquid theory. The gap emergence below a characteristic temperature is the ultimate sign of coherence for a many-body system, which in addition can induce a non-trivial band topology. Here, we demonstrate a simple and efficient method to compare a model study and an experimental result for heavy fermion insulators. The temperature dependence of the gap formation in both local moment and mixed valence regimes is captured within the dynamical mean field (DMFT) approximation to the periodic Anderson model (PAM). Using the topological coherence temperature as the scaling factor and choosing the input parameter set within the mixed valence regime, we can unambiguously link the theoretical energy scales to the experimental ones. As a particularly important result, we find improved consistency between the scaled DMFT density of states and the photoemission near-gap spectra of samarium hexaboride (SmB6).},

Apart from the case where the block is a subsystem of an infinite lattice, also the distribution in finite systems with free [P                                      L                                                        (f)                                  (s)] and periodic [P                                      L                                                        (p)(s)                                  ] boundary conditions is treated. Above the critical pointT                  c                , these distributions tend for largeL towards the same gaussian distribution centered around zero block magnetization, while belowT                  c                 these distributions tend towards two gaussians centered at {\textpm}M, whereM is the spontaneous magnetization appearing in the infinite systems. However, belowT                  c                 the wings of the distribution at small |s| are distinctly nongaussian, reflecting two-phase coexistence. Hence the distribution functions can be used to obtain the interface tension between ordered phases.},

@article{Hubbard63,
	Abstract = {It is pointed out that one of the main effects of correlation phenomena in d- and f-bands is to give rise to behaviour characteristic of the atomic or Heitler-London model. To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.},

@article{Gazit16,
	Abstract = {Lattice gauge theories are used to describe a wide range of phenomena from quark confinement to quantum materials. At finite fermion density, gauge theories are notoriously hard to analyse due to the fermion sign problem. Here, we investigate the Ising gauge theory in 2 + 1 dimensions, a problem of great interest in condensed matter, and show that it is free of the sign problem at arbitrary fermion density. At generic filling, we find that gauge fluctuations mediate pairing, leading to a transition between a deconfined BCS state and a confined BEC. At half-filling, a {$[$}pi{$]$}-flux phase is generated spontaneously with emergent Dirac fermions. The deconfined Dirac phase, with a vanishing Fermi surface volume, is a non-trivial example of violation of Luttinger/'s theorem due to fractionalization. At strong coupling, we find a single continuous transition between the deconfined Dirac phase and the confined BEC, in contrast to the expected split transition.},

	Abstract = {More than 99\% of the mass of the visible universe is made up of protons and neutrons. Both particles are much heavier than their quark and gluon constituents, and the Standard Model of particle physics should explain this difference. We present a full ab initio calculation of the masses of protons, neutrons, and other light hadrons, using lattice quantum chromodynamics. Pion masses down to 190 mega{\textendash}electron volts are used to extrapolate to the physical point, with lattice sizes of approximately four times the inverse pion mass. Three lattice spacings are used for a continuum extrapolation. Our results completely agree with experimental observations and represent a quantitative confirmation of this aspect of the Standard Model with fully controlled uncertainties.},

We focus on methods that combine the framework of effective field theory with computational lattice methods. Lattice effective field theory is discussed for cold atoms as well as low-energy nucleons with and without pions. A number of different lattice formulations and computational algorithms are considered, and an effort is made to show common themes in studies of cold atoms and low-energy nuclear physics as well as common themes in work by different collaborations. },

@article{Gregor11,
	Abstract = {Topological or deconfined phases are characterized by emergent, weakly fluctuating, gauge fields. In condensed matter settings, they inevitably come coupled to excitations that carry the corresponding gauge charges which invalidate the standard diagnostic of deconfinement---the Wilson loop. Inspired by a mapping between symmetric sponges and the deconfined phase of the Z 2 gauge theory, we construct a diagnostic for deconfinement that has the interpretation of a line tension. One operator version of this diagnostic turns out to be the Fredenhagen--Marcu order parameter known to lattice gauge theorists and we show that a different version is best suited to condensed matter systems. We discuss generalizations of the diagnostic, use it to establish the existence of finite temperature topological phases in d ≥3 dimensions and show that multiplets of the diagnostic are useful in settings with multiple phases, such as U (1) gauge theories with charge q matter. (Additionally, we present an exact reduction of the partition function of the toric code in general dimensions to a well-studied problem.)},

@article{Gilbreth15,
	Abstract = {Abstract Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful techniques for studying strongly interacting Fermi systems. However, implementing these methods on computers with finite-precision arithmetic requires careful attention to numerical stability. In the auxiliary-field Monte Carlo (AFMC) method, low-temperature or large-model-space calculations require numerically stabilized matrix multiplication. When adapting methods used in the grand-canonical ensemble to the canonical ensemble of fixed particle number, the numerical stabilization increases the number of required floating-point operations for computing observables by a factor of the size of the single-particle model space, and thus can greatly limit the systems that can be studied. We describe an improved method for stabilizing canonical-ensemble calculations in \{AFMC\} that exhibits better scaling, and present numerical tests that demonstrate the accuracy and improved performance of the method. },

@article{Landau15,
	Abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group method has been extensively used to study the ground state of 1D many-body systems since its introduction two decades ago. In spite of its wide use, this heuristic method is known to fail in certain cases and no certifiably correct implementation is known, leaving researchers faced with an ever-growing toolbox of heuristics, none of which is guaranteed to succeed. Here we develop a polynomial time algorithm that provably finds the ground state of any 1D quantum system described by a gapped local Hamiltonian with constant ground-state energy. The algorithm is based on a framework that combines recently discovered structural features of gapped 1D systems with an efficient construction of a class of operators called approximate ground-state projections (AGSPs). The combination of these tools yields a method that is guaranteed to succeed in all 1D gapped systems. An AGSP-centric approach may help guide the search for algorithms for more general quantum systems, including for the central challenge of 2D systems, where even heuristic methods have had more limited success.},

@article{Shao15,
	Abstract = {Phase transitions can be caused by temperature fluctuations or, more exotically, by quantum fluctuations at zero temperature. To describe some of these quantum phase transitions, researchers came up with a complex theory called deconfined quantum criticality.However, subsequent numerical simulations were inconsistent with some of the predictions of the theory, leading to a debate on its validity. By using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, Shao et al. show that it is possible to reconcile numerics with the theory for a specific model of 2D quantum magnetism.Science, this issue p. 213The theory of deconfined quantum critical (DQC) points describes phase transitions at absolute temperature T = 0 outside the standard paradigm, predicting continuous transformations between certain ordered states where conventional theory would require discontinuities. Numerous computer simulations have offered no proof of such transitions, instead finding deviations from expected scaling relations that neither were predicted by the DQC theory nor conform to standard scenarios. Here we show that this enigma can be resolved by introducing a critical scaling form with two divergent length scales. Simulations of a quantum magnet with antiferromagnetic and dimerized ground states confirm the form, proving a continuous transition with deconfined excitations and also explaining anomalous scaling at T \&gt; 0. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for quantum criticality, with potential implications for many strongly correlated materials.},

	Abstract = {Below a Peierls transition the coupled electron phonon collective mode plays an important role in the conductivity of one-dimensional metal models such as have been recently postulated for various organic compounds. Within the jellium model, or in an incommensurate situation, the mode frequency goes to zero for q → 0 and is responsible for the infinite conductivity first proposed by Fr{\"o}hlich. Impurities, lattice commensurability and three dimensional ordering introduce a gap into the mode spectrum. The low frequency conductivity and a large dielectric constant are predicted. Similar effects are predicted for a spin density wave. Nach den neulich z.B. f{\"u}r verschiedenerlei organische Verbindungen aufgestellten eindimensionalen Metallmodellen spielt unterhalb eines Peierls-{\"U}bergangs die gekoppelte kollektive Elektron-Phonon-Ausbrietungsform bei der Leitf{\"a}higkeit eine wichtige Rolle. Die Formfrequenz geht bei q = 0 im Rahmen des Kolloidmodelles bzw. bei Fehlanpassung gegen 0 und ergibt die erstmals von Fr{\"o}hlich angeregte unendliche Leitf{\"a}higkeit. Fremdatome, Gitteranpassung und r{\"a}umliche Ordnung {\"o}ffnen eine L{\"u}cke im Formspektrum. Die niederfrequente Leitf{\"a}higkeit sowie eine hohe Dielektrizit{\"a}tskonstante werden vorausgesagt. Eine Spindichtewelle l{\"a}sst {\"a}hnliche Effekte erwarten.},

	Abstract = {Quantum critical phenomena may be qualitatively different when massless Dirac fermions are present at criticality. Using our recently-discovered fermion-sign-free Majorana quantum Monte Carlo method introduced by us in (Li et al 2015 Phys. Rev. B 91 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevb.91.241117] 241117 ), we investigate the quantum critical phenomena of spinless Dirac fermions at their charge-density-wave phase transitions on the honeycomb lattice having ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/17/8/085003/njp514351ieqn1.gif] {${N}_{s}=2{L}^{2}$} sites with largest L = 24. By finite-size scaling, we accurately obtain critical exponents of this so-called Gross--Neveu chiral-Ising universality class of two (two-component) Dirac fermions in 2+1D: ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/17/8/085003/njp514351ieqn2.gif] {$\eta =0.45(2)$} , ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/17/8/085003/njp514351ieqn3.gif] {$\nu =0.77(3)$} , and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/17/8/085003/njp514351ieqn4.gif] {$\beta =0.60(3)$} , which are qualitatively different from the mean-field results but are reasonably close to the ones obtained from renormalization group calculations.},

	Abstract = {A new method for the simulation of ground-state properties of interacting fermions is introduced. A trial wave function, which is assumed to be a Slater determinant, is propagated to large imaginary times. The quantum many-body propagator is represented by a coherent superposition of single-particle propagators by means of a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. The resulting functional integral is performed by stochastic methods based on Langevin dynamics. Numerical stability is achieved by orthonormalizing the propagating single-particle orbitals entering the Slater determinant. The problem of the positiveness of the statistical weight is addressed and solved in most cases. Illustrative examples are given for the 1D and 2D Hubbard models.},

@article{Sugiyama86,
	Abstract = {We develop an algorithm for determining the exact ground state properties of quantum many-body systems which is equally applicable to bosons and fermions. The Schroedinger eigenvalue equation for the ground state energy is recast as a many-dimensional integral using the Hubbard-Stratonovitch representation of the imaginary-time many-body evolution operator. The integral is then evaluated stochastically. We test the algorithm for an exactly soluble boson system with an attractive potential and then extend it to fermions and repulsive potentials. Importance sampling is crucial to the success of the method, particularly for more complex systems. Computational efficiency is improved by performing the calculations in Fourier space. },

	Abstract = {We study the entanglement spectrum of Heisenberg spin ladders of arbitrary spin length S in the perturbative regime of strong rung coupling. For isotropic spin coupling the entanglement spectrum is, within first-order perturbation theory, always proportional to the energy spectrum of the single chain with a proportionality factor that is also independent of S . In particular, although the spin ladder possesses an excitation gap over its ground state for any spin length, the entanglement spectrum is gapless for half-integer S and gapful otherwise. A more complicated situation arises for anisotropic ladders of higher spin S ≥ 1 since here even the unperturbed ground state has a nontrivial entanglement spectrum. Finally we discuss related issues in dimerized spin chains.},

A commuting operator is found for arbitrary filling and also for open chains. For a half filled periodic chain it is used to determine the eigenfunctions for the dominant eigenvalues analytically in the continuum limit. Relations to the critical six-vertex model are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We review the properties of reduced density matrices for free fermionic or bosonic many-particle systems in their ground state. Their basic feature is that they have a thermal form and thus lead to a quasi-thermodynamic problem with a certain free-particle Hamiltonian. We discuss the derivation of this result, the character of the Hamiltonian and its eigenstates, the single-particle spectra and the full spectra, the resulting entanglement and in particular the entanglement entropy. This is done for various one- and two-dimensional situations, including also the evolution after global or local quenches.},

@article{Turner11,
	Abstract = {The effect of interactions on topological insulators and superconductors remains, to a large extent, an open problem. Here, we describe a framework for classifying phases of one-dimensional interacting fermions, focusing on spinless fermions with time-reversal symmetry and particle number parity conservation, using concepts of entanglement. In agreement with an example presented by L. Fidkowski and A. Kitaev [Phys. Rev. B 81, 134509 (2010)], we find that in the presence of interactions there are only eight distinct phases which obey a ℤ8 group structure. This is in contrast to the ℤ classification in the noninteracting case. Each of these eight phases is characterized by a unique set of bulk invariants, related to the transformation laws of its entanglement (Schmidt) eigenstates under symmetry operations, and has a characteristic degeneracy of its entanglement levels. If translational symmetry is present, the number of distinct phases increases to 16.},

@article{Pollmann10,
	Abstract = {We show that the Haldane phase of S=1 chains is characterized by a double degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. The degeneracy is protected by a set of symmetries (either the dihedral group of π rotations about two orthogonal axes, time-reversal symmetry, or bond centered inversion symmetry), and cannot be lifted unless either a phase boundary to another, ``topologically trivial,'' phase is crossed, or the symmetry is broken. More generally, these results offer a scheme to classify gapped phases of one-dimensional systems. Physically, the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum can be observed by adiabatically weakening a bond to zero, which leaves the two disconnected halves of the system in a finitely entangled state.},

@article{Holzhey94,
	Abstract = {In statistical physics, useful notions of entropy are defined with respect to some coarse-graining procedure over a microscopic model. Here we consider some special problems that arise when the microscopic model is taken to be relativistic quantum field theory. These problems are associated with the existence of an infinite number of degrees of freedom per unit volume. Because of these the microscopic entropy can, and typically does, diverge for sharply localized states. However, the difference in the entropy between two such states is better behaved, and for most purposes it is the useful quantity to consider. In particular, a renormalized entropy can be defined as the entropy relative to the ground state. We make these remarks quantitative and precise in a simple model situation: the states of a conformal quantum field theory excited by a moving mirror. From this work, we attempt to draw some lessons concerning the ``information problem'' in black hole physics. },

	Abstract = {Spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice provide a minimal realization of lattice Dirac fermions. Repulsive interactions between nearest neighbors drive a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a charge-density-wave state through a fermionic quantum critical point, where the coupling of the Ising order parameter to the Dirac fermions at low energy drastically affects the quantum critical behavior. Encouraged by a recent discovery (Huffman and Chandrasekharan 2014 Phys. Rev. B 89 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.89.111101] 111101 ) of the absence of the fermion sign problem in this model, we study the fermionic quantum critical point using the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method with a worm-sampling technique. We estimate the transition point ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/16/10/103008/njp502274ieqn1.gif] {$V/t=1.356(1)$} with the critical exponents ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/16/10/103008/njp502274ieqn2.gif] {$\nu =0.80(3)$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/16/10/103008/njp502274ieqn3.gif] {$\eta =0.302(7)$} .

@article{Tang14,
	Abstract = {Topological crystalline insulators in IV-VI compounds host novel topological surface states consisting of multi-valley massless Dirac fermions at low energy. Here we show that strain generically acts as an effective gauge field on these Dirac fermions and creates pseudo-Landau orbitals without breaking time-reversal symmetry. We predict the realization of this phenomenon in IV-VI semiconductor heterostructures, due to a naturally occurring misfit dislocation array at the interface that produces a periodically varying strain field. Remarkably, the zero-energy Landau orbitals form a flat band in the vicinity of the Dirac point, and coexist with a network of snake states at higher energy. We propose that the high density of states of this flat band gives rise to interface superconductivity observed in IV-VI semiconductor multilayers at unusually high temperatures, with non-Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer behaviour. Our work demonstrates a new route to altering macroscopic electronic properties to achieve a partially flat band, and provides a starting point for realizing novel correlated states of matter.},

	Abstract = {We carry out a systematic study of entanglement entropy in relativistic quantum field theory. This is defined as the von Neumann entropy S A = −Tr ρ A logρ A corresponding to the reduced density matrix ρ A of a subsystem A . For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c , we re-derive the result ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2004/06/P06002/jstat181343ieqn1.gif] {S_{\mathrm {A}}\sim (c/3)\log \ell} of Holzhey et al when A is a finite interval of length ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2004/06/P06002/jstat181343ieqn2.gif] {\ell} in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems, finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length ξ is large but finite, we show that ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2004/06/P06002/jstat181343ieqn3.gif] {S_{\mathrm {A}}\sim {\cal A}(c/6)\log \xi } , where ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1742-5468/2004/06/P06002/jstat181343ieqn4.gif] {\cal A} is the number of boundary points of A . These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition.},

@article{Casini04,
	Abstract = {The trace over the degrees of freedom located in a subset of the space transforms the vacuum state into a mixed density matrix with nonzero entropy. This is usually called entanglement entropy, and it is known to be divergent in quantum field theory (QFT). However, it is possible to define a finite quantity F ( A , B ) for two given different subsets A and B which measures the degree of entanglement between their respective degrees of freedom. We show that the function F ( A , B ) is severely constrained by the Poincar{\'e} symmetry and the mathematical properties of the entropy. In particular, for one component sets in two-dimensional conformal field theories its general form is completely determined. Moreover, it allows to prove an alternative entropic version of the c-theorem for ( 1 + 1 ) -dimensional QFT. We propose this well-defined quantity as the meaningfull entanglement entropy and comment on possible applications in \{QFT\} and the black hole evaporation problem. },

For systems of interacting spin or bosonic degrees of freedom much recent progress has been made not only in the analytical description of their respective entanglement entropies but also in their numerical classification. Systems of interacting fermionic degrees of freedom, however, have proved to be more difficult to control, in particular with regard to the numerical understanding of their entanglement properties. Here we report a generalization of the replica technique for the calculation of R{\'e}nyi entropies to the framework of determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo simulations---the numerical method of choice for unbiased, large-scale simulations of interacting fermionic systems. We demonstrate the strength of this approach over a recent alternative proposal based on a decomposition in free fermion Green's functions by studying the entanglement entropy of one-dimensional Hubbard systems both at zero and finite temperatures.},

	Abstract = {Abstract This is a partly non-technical introduction to selected topics on tensor network methods, based on several lectures and introductory seminars given on the subject. It should be a good place for newcomers to get familiarized with some of the key ideas in the field, specially regarding the numerics. After a very general introduction we motivate the concept of tensor network and provide several examples. We then move on to explain some basics about Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS). Selected details on some of the associated numerical methods for 1 d and 2 d quantum lattice systems are also discussed. },

@article{ALPS20,
	Abstract = {We present release 2.0 of the ALPS (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations) project, an open source software project to develop libraries and application programs for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum lattice models such as quantum magnets, lattice bosons, and strongly correlated fermion systems. The code development is centered on common XML and HDF5 data formats, libraries to simplify and speed up code development, common evaluation and plotting tools, and simulation programs. The programs enable non-experts to start carrying out serial or parallel numerical simulations by providing basic implementations of the important algorithms for quantum lattice models: classical and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) using non-local updates, extended ensemble simulations, exact and full diagonalization (ED), the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) both in a static version and a dynamic time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) code, and quantum Monte Carlo solvers for dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The ALPS libraries provide a powerful framework for programmers to develop their own applications, which, for instance, greatly simplify the steps of porting a serial code onto a parallel, distributed memory machine. Major changes in release 2.0 include the use of HDF5 for binary data, evaluation tools in Python, support for the Windows operating system, the use of CMake as build system and binary installation packages for Mac OS X and Windows, and integration with the VisTrails workflow provenance tool. The software is available from our web server at http://alps.comp-phys.org/ [http://alps.comp-phys.org/] .},

	Abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that \{DMRG\} operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the \{DMRG\} method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current \{DMRG\} thinking in the \{MPS\} language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of \{DMRG\} algorithms in exclusively \{MPS\} terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while \{DMRG\} is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms. },

@article{Volovik88,
	Abstract = {
The quantum Hall effect is discussed for charged and neutral superfluid Fermi liquids with an order parameter like the one of 3He-A.Owing to the nontrivial structure of this order parameter a quantum Hall effect occurs in the absence of a magnetic field. Under the influence of an electric field, or its analog for the case of a neutral fluid ( a gradient of the chemical potential) there appears, in addition to the longitudinal superfluid current, a transverse current with Hall conductivity uxy,which in the weak-coupling approximation takes on half-integer values ( I/ 2)(Ne2/h) intermsoffundamentalunits.Thequantizationoftheparameterox,,isthe consequence of an integer-valued topological invariant of the Bogolyubov matrices in momentum space, invariant which in 3He-A takes on the values + 1 or - 1, depending on the orientation of the orbital angular momentum vector 1relative to the normal to the film. As the thickness of the film is varied the quantity Nchanges discontinuously at certain values of the thickness. At the transition point from one plateau to the next in the graph of the dependence of uxyon an external parameter, the gap in the Fermi quasiparticle spectrum vanishes. The relation of this effect to the topological Chern-Simons mass term in 2 + I-dimensional quantum electrodynamics is discussed.},

	Abstract = {We use a determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulation and a mean-field approach to study the Rashba spin-orbit coupled Fermi gases in square optical lattice. Notably, we show that the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules phase transition temperature can be enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling. The superfluidity is always dominated by spin-singlet pairing when the attraction or the spin-orbit coupling increases. Moreover, the spin susceptibility is shown to be anisotropic and attends a steady value in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling.},

@phdthesis{Luitz_thesis,
	Abstract = {This thesis presents results covering several topics in correlated many fermion systems. A Monte Carlo technique (CT-INT) that has been implemented, used and extended by the author is discussed in great detail in chapter 3. The following chapter discusses how CT-INT can be used to calculate the two particle Green's function and explains how exact frequency summations can be obtained. A benchmark against exact diagonalization is presented. The link to the dynamical cluster approximation is made in the end of chapter 4, where these techniques are of immense importance. In chapter 5 an extensive CT-INT study of a strongly correlated Josephson junction is shown. In particular, the signature of the first order quantum phase transition between a Kondo and a local moment regime in the Josephson current is discussed. The connection to an experimental system is made with great care by developing a parameter extraction strategy. As a final result, we show that it is possible to reproduce experimental data from a numerically exact CT-INT model-calculation. The last topic is a study of graphene edge magnetism. We introduce a general effective model for the edge states, incorporating a complicated interaction Hamiltonian and perform an exact diagonalization study for different parameter regimes. This yields a strong argument for the importance of forbidden umklapp processes and of the strongly momentum dependent interaction vertex for the formation of edge magnetism. Additional fragments concerning the use of a Legendre polynomial basis for the representation of the two particle Green's function, the analytic continuation of the self energy for the Anderson Kane Mele Model, as well as the generation of test data with a given covariance matrix are documented in the appendix. A final appendix provides some very important matrix identities that are used for the discussion of technical details of CT-INT.},

@article{Hohenadler12b,
	Abstract = {We use continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study retardation effects in the metallic, quarter-filled Holstein model in one dimension. Based on results which include the one- and two-particle spectral functions as well as the optical conductivity, we conclude that with increasing phonon frequency the ground state evolves from one with dominant diagonal order---2 k F charge correlations---to one with dominant off-diagonal fluctuations, namely s-wave pairing correlations. In the parameter range of this crossover, our numerical results support the existence of a spin gap for all phonon frequencies. The crossover can hence be interpreted in terms of preformed pairs corresponding to bipolarons, which are essentially localized in the Peierls phase, and `condense' with increasing phonon frequency to generate dominant pairing correlations.},

	Abstract = {Topological band insulators have recently been discovered in spin-orbit coupled two-and three-dimensional systems. We theoretically predict a class of topological insulators where interaction effects play a dominant role. In actinide elements, simple rocksalt compounds formed by Pu and Am lie on the boundary between metals and insulators. We show that interaction drives a quantum phase transition to a topological insulator phase with a single Dirac cone on the surface. These putative topological insulators may provide a setting for both applied and fundamental investigation.},

@article{Berg12,
	Abstract = {The quantum theory of antiferromagnetism in metals is necessary for our understanding of numerous intermetallic compounds of widespread interest. In these systems, a quantum critical point emerges as external parameters (such as chemical doping) are varied. Because of the strong coupling nature of this critical point and the ``sign problem'' plaguing numerical quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, its theoretical understanding is still incomplete. Here, we show that the universal low-energy theory for the onset of antiferromagnetism in a metal can be realized in lattice models, which are free from the sign problem and hence can be simulated efficiently with QMC. Our simulations show Fermi surface reconstruction and unconventional spin-singlet superconductivity across the critical point.},

@article{Schmidt12,
	Abstract = {Motivated by the recent discovery of a spin-liquid phase for the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice at half-filling (Meng et al 2010 Nature 88 487), we apply both perturbative and non-perturbative techniques to derive effective spin Hamiltonians describing the low-energy physics of the Mott-insulating phase of the system. Exact diagonalizations of the so-derived models on small clusters are performed, in order to assess the quality of the effective low-energy theory in the spin-liquid regime. We show that six-spin interactions on the elementary loop of the honeycomb lattice are the dominant sub-leading effective couplings. A minimal spin model is shown to reproduce most of the energetic properties of the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice in its spin-liquid phase. Surprisingly, a more elaborate effective low-energy spin model obtained by a systematic graph expansion rather disagrees beyond a certain point with the numerical results for the Hubbard model at intermediate couplings.},

@article{Anderson04,
	Abstract = {One of the first theoretical proposals for understanding high-temperature superconductivity in the cuprates was Anderson's RVB theory using a Gutzwiller projected BCS wavefunction as an approximate ground state. Recent work by Paramekanti et al has shown that this variational approach gives a semi-quantitative understanding of the doping dependences of a variety of experimental observables in the superconducting state of the cuprates. In this paper we revisit these issues using the 'renormalized mean field theory' of Zhang et al based on the Gutzwiller approximation in which the kinetic and superexchange energies are renormalized by different doping-dependent factors g t and g S respectively. We point out a number of consequences of this early mean field theory for experimental measurements which were not available when it was first explored, and observe that it is able to explain the existence of the pseudogap, properties of nodal quasiparticles and approximate spin--charge separation, the latter leading to large renormalizations of the Drude weight and superfluid density. We use the Lee--Wen theory of the phase transition as caused by thermal excitation of nodal quasiparticles, and also obtain a number of further experimental confirmations. Finally, we remark that superexchange, and not phonons, is responsible for d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates.},

We trapped electrons, confined as a two-dimensional gas in a gallium arsenide quantum well, in a nanofabricated lattice with honeycomb geometry. We probed the excitation spectrum in a magnetic field, identifying collective modes that emerged from the Coulomb interaction in the artificial lattice, as predicted by the Mott-Hubbard model. These observations allow us to determine the Hubbard gap and suggest the existence of a Coulomb-driven ground state.},

	Abstract = {In a system with an even number of \{SU\} ( 2 ) spins, there is an overcomplete set of states---consisting of all possible pairings of the spins into valence bonds---that spans the S = 0 Hilbert subspace. Operator expectation values in this basis are related to the properties of the closed loops that are formed by the overlap of valence bond states. We construct a generating function for spin correlation functions of arbitrary order and show that all nonvanishing contributions arise from configurations that are topologically irreducible. We derive explicit formulas for the correlation functions at second, fourth, and sixth order. We then extend the valence bond basis to include triplet bonds and discuss how to compute properties that are related to operators acting outside the singlet sector. These results are relevant to analytical calculations and to numerical valence bond simulations using quantum Monte Carlo, variational wavefunctions, or exact diagonalization. },

The low-temperature properties (T«T K) are then described phenomenologically in the same spirit as the usual Landau theory of Fermi liquids. The specific heat, spin susceptibility, and resistivity are expressed in terms of a small number of numerical parameters. In the strong coupling case the latter may be obtained via perturbation theory; in the opposite weak coupling limit they must be fitted to Wilson's recent numerical results.},

@article{Bernevig06,
	Abstract = {We show that the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, a state of matter with topological properties distinct from those of conventional insulators, can be realized in mercury telluride-cadmium telluride semiconductor quantum wells. When the thickness of the quantum well is varied, the electronic state changes from a normal to an "inverted" type at a critical thickness dc. We show that this transition is a topological quantum phase transition between a conventional insulating phase and a phase exhibiting the QSH effect with a single pair of helical edge states. We also discuss methods for experimental detection of the QSH effect.

@article{Anderson87,
	Abstract = {The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La2CuO4, have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought "resonating-valence-bond" state or "quantum spin liquid" hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

	Abstract = {The theory of second-order phase transitions is one of the foundations of modern statistical mechanics and condensed-matter theory. A central concept is the observable order parameter, whose nonzero average value characterizes one or more phases. At large distances and long times, fluctuations of the order parameter(s) are described by a continuum field theory, and these dominate the physics near such phase transitions. We show that near second-order quantum phase transitions, subtle quantum interference effects can invalidate this paradigm, and we present a theory of quantum critical points in a variety of experimentally relevant two-dimensional antiferromagnets. The critical points separate phases characterized by conventional {\textquotedblleft}confining{\textquotedblright} order parameters. Nevertheless, the critical theory contains an emergent gauge field and {\textquotedblleft}deconfined{\textquotedblright} degrees of freedom associated with fractionalization of the order parameters. We propose that this paradigm for quantum criticality may be the key to resolving a number of experimental puzzles in correlated electron systems and offer a new perspective on the properties of complex materials.},

	Abstract = {The conjectured F-theorem for three-dimensional field theories states that the finite part of the free energy on S                3 decreases along RG trajectories and is stationary at the fixed points. In previous work various successful tests of this proposal were carried out for theories with                                                                           {\$} {\backslash}mathcal{\{}N{\}} = 2 {\$}                 supersymmetry. In this paper we perform more general tests that do not rely on supersymmetry. We study perturbatively the RG flows produced by weakly relevant operators and show that the free energy decreases monotonically. We also consider large N field theories perturbed by relevant double trace operators, free massive field theories, and some non-Abelian gauge theories. In all cases the free energy in the IR is smaller than in the UV, consistent with the F-theorem. We discuss other odd-dimensional Euclidean theories on S                                  d                 and provide evidence that (‚{\`a}{\'\i}1)(d‚{\`a}{\'\i}1)/2 log|Z| decreases along RG flow; in the particular case d{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1 this is the well-known g-theorem.},

@article{Zohar16,
	Abstract = {Can high-energy physics be simulated by low-energy, non-relativistic, many-body systems such as ultracold atoms? Such ultracold atomic systems lack the type of symmetries and dynamical properties of high energy physics models: in particular, they manifest neither local gauge invariance nor Lorentz invariance, which are crucial properties of the quantum field theories which are the building blocks of the standard model of elementary particles. However, it turns out, surprisingly, that there are ways to configure an atomic system to manifest both local gauge invariance and Lorentz invariance. In particular, local gauge invariance can arise either as an effective low-energy symmetry, or as an exact symmetry, following from the conservation laws in atomic interactions. Hence, one could hope that such quantum simulators may lead to a new type of (table-top) experiments which will be used to study various QCD (quantum chromodynamics) phenomena, such as the confinement of dynamical quarks, phase transitions and other effects, which are inaccessible using the currently known computational methods. In this report, we review the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories, and then describe our recent progress in constructing the quantum simulation of Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in 1‚{\"A}{\^a}‚{\"A}{\^a}+‚{\"A}{\^a}‚{\"A}{\^a}1 and 2‚{\"A}{\^a}‚{\"A}{\^a}+‚{\"A}{\^a}‚{\"A}{\^a}1 dimensions using ultracold atoms in optical lattices.},

	Abstract = {The heavy-fermion compound CePdAl with ZrNiAl-type crystal structure (hexagonal space group ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/8/50/043/img8.gif] ) was investigated by powder neutron diffraction. The triangular coordination symmetry of magnetic Ce atoms on site 3f gives rise to geometrical frustration. CePdAl orders below ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/8/50/043/img9.gif] with an incommensurate antiferromagnetic propagation vector ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-8984/8/50/043/img10.gif] , and a longitudinal sine-wave (LSW) modulated spin arrangement. Magnetically ordered moments at Ce(1) and Ce(3) coexist with frustrated disordered moments at Ce(2). The experimentally determined magnetic structure is in agreement with group theoretical symmetry analysis considerations, calculated by the program MODY, which confirm that for Ce(2) an ordered magnetic moment parallel to the magnetically easy c-axis is forbidden by symmetry. Further low-temperature experiments give evidence for a second magnetic phase transition in CePdAl between 0.6 and 1.3 K. Magnetic structures of CePdAl are compared with those of the isostructural compound TbNiAl, where a non-zero ordered magnetic moment for the geometrically frustrated Tb(2) atoms is allowed by symmetry.},
