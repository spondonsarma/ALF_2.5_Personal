\subsection{Predefined trial wave functions} \label{sec:predefined_trial_wave_function}

When using the projective algorithm (see Sec.~\ref{sec:defT0}), trial wave functions must be specified.
%These are stored in variables of the \texttt{WaveFunction} type.
%, which includes the routine \path{WF_overlap(WF_L, WF_R, Z_norm)} for normalizing the right trial wave function, such that $\langle \Psi_{T,L} | \Psi_{T,R} \rangle = 1$.
The ALF package provides a set of trial wave functions, corresponding to the solution of the non-interacting tight binding Hamiltonian on one of the predefined lattices, namely:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Square
	\item Honeycomb
	\item N-leg ladder
	\item Bilayer square
	\item Bilayer honeycomb
\end{itemize}

The wave functions $|\Psi_{T,L/R}\rangle$=\texttt{WF\_L/R} are returned by the call:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=fortran]
Call Predefined_TrialWaveFunction(Lattice_type, Ndim, List, Invlist, Latt, Latt_unit, N_part,
                             N_FL, WF_L, WF_R)
\end{lstlisting}

Twisted boundary conditions (\texttt{Phi\_X\_vec=0.01}) are implemented so as to generate non-degenerate trial wave functions.
