\label{Predefined_chap}
The ALF package includes predefined structures, which the user can combine together or use as templates for defining new ones. Using the data types defined in the Sec.~\ref{sec:imp} the following modules are available:
\begin{itemize}
	\item lattices and unit cells -- \texttt{Predefined\_Latt\_mod.F90}
	\item hopping Hamiltonians -- \texttt{Predefined\_Hop\_mod.F90 }
	\item interaction Hamiltonians -- \texttt{Predefined\_Int\_mod.F90}
	\item observables -- \texttt{Predefined\_Obs\_mod.F90 }
	\item trial wave functions -- \texttt{Predefined\_Trial\_mod.F90 }
\end{itemize}
which we describe in the remaining of this section.

% \red{TODO} Go through everything one has to defined/set in order to define a new Hamiltonian. \red{TODO}\\

%We'd perhaps want to provide a \emph{minimum} Hamiltonian, probably written in pseudo-code, from which one could write their own.\\ \\
%
%\noindent A \emph{complete} list of all the code that would have to be changed for the \emph{most general} case could read as:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Hamiltonian -- one-body, imaginary-time propagator for a given configuration of HS and  Ising fields
%	\item Table~\ref{table:hamiltonian}:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item \texttt{Ham\_Set}
%		\item \texttt{Ham\_V}
%		\item \texttt{S0}
%		\item \texttt{Setup\_Ising\_action}
%		\item \texttt{Global\_move}
%		\item \texttt{Delta\_S0\_global}
%		\item \texttt{Global\_move\_tau}
%		\item \texttt{Alloc\_obs}
%		\item \texttt{Obser}
%		\item \texttt{ObserT}
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item Check Table~\ref{table:operator} (Operator type).
%	\item Table~\ref{table:lattice} and \ref{table:unit_cell}:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item \texttt{Lattice\%a1\_p}, \texttt{Lattice\%a2\_p}
%		\item \texttt{Lattice\%L1\_p}, \texttt{Lattice\%L2\_p}
%		\item \texttt{Lattice\%N}
