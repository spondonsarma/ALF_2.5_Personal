The ALF  library comes with five model classes: (i) SU(N) Hubbard models, (ii) O(2N) t-V models, (iii) Kondo models, (iv) long-range Coulomb models, and (v) generic $\Ztwo$ lattice gauge theories coupled to $\Ztwo$ matter and fermions. Below we detail the functioning of these classes.  


\subsection{SU(N) Hubbard models \texttt{Hamiltonian\_Hubbard\_mod.F90}} \label{sec:hubbard}

The parameter space for this model class  reads: 

\begin{lstlisting}[style=fortran,escapechar=\#,breaklines=true]
&VAR_Hubbard               !! Variables for the Hubbard class
Mz        = .T.             ! Whether to use the M_z-Hubbard model: Nf=2; N_SUN must be  
                            ! even. HS field couples to the z-component of magnetization
ham_T     = 1.d0            ! Hopping parameter
ham_chem  = 0.d0            ! Chemical potential
ham_U     = 4.d0            ! Hubbard interaction
ham_T2    = 1.d0            ! For bilayer systems
ham_U2    = 4.d0            ! For bilayer systems
ham_Tperp = 1.d0            ! For bilayer systems
/
               
\end{lstlisting}
In the above listing, \texttt{ham\_T} and \texttt{ham\_T2} correspond to the hopping in the first and second layers respectively and  \texttt{ham\_Tperp} is to the interlayer hopping.   The Hubbard $U$ term has an orbital index, \texttt{ham\_U}  for the first and \texttt{ham\_U2} for the second layers.  Finall,  \texttt{ham\_chem}  corresponds to the chemical potential.    If the flag \texttt{Mz} is set to \texttt{.False.}, then the code simulates the following SU(N) symmetric Hubbard model:
\begin{multline}
\hat{H} = \sum_{(\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), (\ve{j},\ve{\delta}')}  \sum_{\sigma =1}^{N}  T_{(\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), (\ve{j},\ve{\delta}')}    \hat{c}^{\dagger}_{(\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), \sigma }   e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{\Phi_0} \int_{\ve{i} + \ve{\delta}}^{\ve{j} + \ve{\delta}'}  
     \vec{A}(\ve{l})  d \ve{l}} \hat{c}^{}_{(\ve{j},\ve{\delta}'),\sigma} \\
 + \sum_{\vec{i}} \sum_{\delta}   \frac{U_{\ve{\delta}} }{N} \left(\sum_{\sigma=1}^{N}  \left[   \hat{c}^{\dagger}_{(\vec{i},\ve{\delta}),\sigma } 
    \hat{c}^{\phantom\dagger}_{(\vec{i}, \ve{\delta}),\sigma }  - 1/2  \right] \right)^2
    - \mu \sum_{(\ve{i},\ve{\delta})}  \sum_{\sigma =1}^{N} \hat{c}^{\dagger}_{(\vec{i},\ve{\delta}),\sigma } \hat{c}^{\phantom\dagger}_{(\vec{i},\ve{\delta}),\sigma } .
\end{multline}
The  generic hopping is taken fron Eq.~\ref{generic_hopping.eq}   with appropriate boundary conditions given by Eq.~\ref{generic_boundary.eq}.  The index $\ve{i}$ runs over the unit cells, $\ve{\delta}$ over the orbitals in each unit cell and $\sigma$  from $1$ to $N$  and encodes the SU(N) symmetry.    Note that  $N$ corresponds to \texttt{N\_SUN}  in the code.  The flavor index is set to  unity such that it does not appear in the  Hamiltonian. The chemical potential $\mu$ is relevant only for the finite temperature code. 

If the variable \texttt{Mz} is set to \texttt{.True.}, then the code requires  \texttt{N\_SUN}  to be even and simulates the following Hamiltonian: 
\begin{align}
\hat{H} =& \sum_{(\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), (\ve{j},\ve{\delta}')}  \sum_{\sigma =1}^{N/2}  \sum_{s=1,2} T_{(\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), (\ve{j},\ve{\delta}')}    \hat{c}^{\dagger}_{(\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), \sigma,s }   e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{\Phi_0} \int_{\ve{i} + \ve{\delta}}^{\ve{j} + \ve{\delta}'}  
     \vec{A}(\ve{l})  d \ve{l}} \hat{c}^{}_{(\ve{j},\ve{\delta}'),\sigma,s}     \nonumber   \\
    &- \sum_{\vec{i}} \sum_{\delta}   \frac{U_\delta}{N} \left(\sum_{\sigma=1}^{N/2}  \left[   \hat{c}^{\dagger}_{(\vec{i},\ve{\delta}),\sigma, 2} 
    \hat{c}^{\phantom\dagger}_{(\vec{i}, \ve{\delta}),\sigma,2 }  -  \hat{c}^{\dagger}_{(\vec{i},\ve{\delta}),\sigma, 1} 
    \hat{c}^{\phantom\dagger}_{(\vec{i}, \ve{\delta}),\sigma,1} \right]Â \right)^2  \nonumber \\
    & - \mu \sum_{(\ve{i},\ve{\delta})}  \sum_{\sigma =1}^{N/2}  \sum_{s=1,2}\hat{c}^{\dagger}_{(\vec{i},\ve{\delta}),\sigma, s} \hat{c}^{\phantom\dagger}_{(\vec{i},\ve{\delta}),\sigma, s}.
\end{align}
In this case, the flavor index \texttt{N\_FL}   takes the value 2. Cleary at $N=2$, both modes  correspond  to the Hubbard model.  For $N$  even and $N > 2$  the models differ.  In particular  in the latter  Hamiltonian the U(N) symmetry is broken down to  U(N/2) $\otimes$ U(N/2).  

Since this model class  works for all predefined lattices  (see Fig.~\ref{fig_predefined_lattices}) 
it includes the SU(N) periodic Anderson model on the square and Honeycomb lattices.
Finally, we note that the executable for this class is given by \texttt{Hubbard.out}.

As an example,  we can consider the periodic Anderson model.   Here we choose  the \texttt{Bilayer\_square}  lattice \texttt{Ham\_U} =  \texttt{Ham\_T2} $= 0$,  \texttt{Ham\_U2}$=U_f$,  \texttt{Ham\_tperp}$=V$  and \texttt{Ham\_T}$=1$.   The  pyALF  based python script    \href{https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/pyALF/-/blob/master/Scripts/Hubbard_PAM.py}{\texttt{Hubbard\_PAM.py}}  produces the data  shown in  Fig.~\ref{Fig:PAM}  for the L=8 lattice.  

\begin{figure}

\caption{The periodic Anderson model.  Here we  plot the  equal-time spin structure factor  of the f-electrons  at $\ve{q} = (\pi,\pi)$.   This quantity is found in the file \texttt{SpinZ\_eqJK}.  The  pyALF  based python script    \href{https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/pyALF/-/blob/master/Scripts/Hubbard_PAM.py}{\texttt{Hubbard\_PAM.py}}  produces the data  shown for the $L=8$ lattice.    One sees  that for the chosen value of $U_f/t$  the competition between the RKKY interaction and  Kondo screening drives the system through a magnetic order-disorder transition at $V_c/t \simeq 1$  \cite{Vekic95}.}

%{\color{red}  If we do a good job in the previous sections we actually do not need much more explanation for this.   We could also provide Juypyter notebooks to start a set of Hubbard  hamiltonians.  e.g.  
%\begin{itemize}
%\item   \texttt{Pam\_square.ipynb}            SU(N) Square lattice PAM 
%\item  \texttt{Pam\_honeycomb.ipynb}     SU(N) Honeycomb lattice lattice PAM 
%\item  \texttt{Bilayer\_Hubbard.ipynb}      SU(N) Hubbard model on bilayers.
%\item  \texttt{N\_leg\_ladder\_Hubbard.ipynb}   SU(N) n-leg-ladder  Hubbard
%\item ...
%\end{itemize} 
%Would be nice to discuss this point.}


\subsection{O(2N)  t-V models  \texttt{tV\_mod.F90}}

%This would include the SU(N)  $t-V$ models on various lattices.  The defining property of this set of Hamiltonians would be the enlarged O(2N) symmetry.  Again  this   module should support our standard bipartite lattices. 

The parameter space for this model class  reads: 

\begin{lstlisting}[style=fortran,escapechar=\#,breaklines=true]
&VAR_tV                    !! Variables for the t-V class
ham_T     = 1.d0            ! Hopping parameter
ham_chem  = 0.d0            ! Chemical potential
ham_V     = 0.5d0           ! interaction strength
ham_T2    = 1.d0            ! For bilayer systems
ham_V2    = 0.5d0           ! For bilayer systems
ham_Tperp = 1.d0            ! For bilayer systems
ham_Vperp = 0.5d0           ! For bilayer systems
/

\end{lstlisting}
In the above   \texttt{ham\_T} and \texttt{ham\_T2} and \texttt{ham\_Tperp}   correspond to the hopping in the first and second layers respectively and  \texttt{ham\_Tperp}   is to the interlayer hopping.   The interaction term has an orbital index, 
\texttt{ham\_V}  for the first and  \texttt{ham\_V2}  for the second layers,  and \texttt{ham\_Vperp} for interlayer coupling. Note the we use the same sign conventions here for both the hopping parameters and the interaction strength. This implies a relative minus sign between here and the $U_\delta$ interaction strength of the Hubbard model (see Sec.~\ref{sec:hubbard}).
Finally   \texttt{ham\_chem}  corresponds to the chemical potential. Let us define the operator
\begin{equation}
\hat{b}_{\langle (\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), (\ve{j},\ve{\delta}') \rangle} =  \sum_{\sigma =1}^{N}    \hat{c}^{\dagger}_{(\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), \sigma }   e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{\Phi_0} \int_{\ve{i} + \ve{\delta}}^{\ve{j} + \ve{\delta}'}  
	\vec{A}(\ve{l})  d \ve{l}} \hat{c}^{}_{(\ve{j},\ve{\delta}'),\sigma} 
+ \textrm{H.c.}
\end{equation}
The model is then defined as follows:
\begin{align}
\hat{H}= & \sum_{\langle (\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), (\ve{j},\ve{\delta}') \rangle}   T_{(\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), (\ve{j},\ve{\delta}')}    \hat{b}_{\langle (\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), (\ve{j},\ve{\delta}') \rangle}
+ \sum_{\langle (\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), (\ve{j},\ve{\delta}') \rangle}  \frac{V_{(\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), (\ve{j},\ve{\delta}')}}{N} \left(  \hat{b}_{\langle (\ve{i},\ve{\delta}), (\ve{j},\ve{\delta}') \rangle}  \right)^2  \nonumber \\
& - \mu \sum_{(\ve{i},\ve{\delta})}  \sum_{\sigma =1}^{N} \hat{c}^{\dagger}_{(\vec{i},\ve{\delta}),\sigma } \hat{c}^{\phantom\dagger}_{(\vec{i},\ve{\delta}),\sigma } \,.
\end{align}
The generic hopping is taken from Eq.~\ref{generic_hopping.eq} with appropriate boundary conditions given by Eq.~\ref{generic_boundary.eq}. The index $\ve{i}$ runs over the unit cells, $\ve{\delta}$ over the orbitals in each unit cell and $\sigma$  from $1$ to $N$,  encoding the SU(N) symmetry.
Note that $N$ corresponds to \texttt{N\_SUN}  in the code.
The flavor index is set to unity such that it does not appear in the  Hamiltonian.
The chemical potential $\mu$ is relevant only for the finite temperature code.
An example showing how to run this model class can be found in the pyALF based Jupyter notebook   
\href{https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/pyALF/-/blob/master/Notebooks/tV_model.ipynb}{\texttt{tV\_model.ipynb}}.

As a concrete example, we can consider the Hamiltonian of the t-V model of SU(N) fermions on the square lattice,
\begin{align}
\hat{H}= & -t \sum_{\langle \ve{i}, \ve{j} \rangle}  \hat{b}_{\langle \ve{i}, \ve{j} \rangle}
- \frac{V}{N} \sum_{\langle \ve{i}, \ve{j} \rangle}  \left(  \hat{b}_{\langle \ve{i}, \ve{j} \rangle}  \right)^2   - \mu \sum_{\ve{i}}  \sum_{\sigma =1}^{N} \hat{c}^{\dagger}_{\vec{i},\sigma } \hat{c}^{\phantom\dagger}_{\vec{i},\sigma } \,,
\end{align} 
which can be simulated by setting $\texttt{ham\_T}=t$, $\texttt{ham\_V} = V$, and $\texttt{ham\_chem}=\mu$.
At half-band filling $\mu =0$, the sign problem is absent for $V>0$ and for all values of $N$.  For even values of $N$ no sign problem occurs for $V>0$ and arbitrary chemical potentials.   

Note  that  in the absence of orbital magnetic fields,  the model has an $O(2N)$ symmetry. This can be seen by writing the model in a Majorana basis (see e.g. Ref.~\cite{Assaad16}).

%I suggest to work on the  Hamiltonian of Ref.~\ref{Z2.Sec} since this is the most general  model I can think of.   Would be nice to add a Hubbard-$U$ term.  It is actually not so easy to generalize this model to 
%arbitrary lattices, so that for the moment, I would concentrate only on the square lattice.
