When we were discussing how to make the ALF code generally available to the world we quickly
agreed that it should be open source so that people can benefit and we have the the hope that the code 
proves useful to others and makes some contribution to the scientific community.
Nevertheless we are all scientists and we have to make ends meet in our careers. Therefore we felt that the scientific practice 
of giving a citation back if one has benefitted from another person's work is something that we felt we can reciprocally hope for, from our users.
To facilitate the communication with our users we have set up our project's homepage \url{alf.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de}
and we hope that it gives us the tools to create a small but vibrant community around the code and provides a suitable
entrypoint for future contributors.
The homepage is also the place where the original source files can be found.
With the coming public release it was necessary to add copyright headers to our source files and to think about the licensing
of our software and therefore the question was on the table of how to make those ideas part of our licensing scheme.
We felt that the Creative Commons licenses are a good way to share our documentation and it is also
accepted well with publishers. Therefore this documentation is licensed to you under a CC-BY-SA license.
This means you can share it and redistribute it as long as you cite the original source and
license your changes under the same license. The details are in the file license.CCBYSA that you shou have received with this documentation.
The source code itself is licensed under a GPL license to keep the source as well as any future work in the community.
To express our desire for a proper attribution we decided to make this a visible part of the license.
To that end we have exercised the rights of section 7 of GPL version 3 and have amended
the license terms with an additional paragraph that expresses our wish that if an author has benfitted from this code
that he/she should consider giving back a citation as specified on \url{alf.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de}.
This is not something that is meant to restrict your freedom of use, but something that we strongly expect to be good scientific conduct.
The original GPL license can be found in the file license.GPL and the additional terms can be found in license.additional.
In favour to our users, \textit{ALF} contains part of the lapack implementation version 3.6.1 from \url{http://www.netlib.org/lapack}.
Lapack is licensed under the modified BSD license whose full text can be found in license.BSD.\\
With that being said, we hope that ALF will prove to you to be a suitable and highly performant tool that enables
you to perform Monte Carlo studies of solid state models of unprecedented complexity.\\
