will be useful.  If you benefit from this code  we ask that you acknowledge  the ALF collaboration  as mentioned on our website \url{https://alf.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de}.  The git repository at \url{https://git.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ALF/ALF} gives us the tools to create a small but vibrant community around the code and provides a suitable entry point for future contributors  and future developments. 
The website is also the place where the original source files can be found.
Its public release make it necessary to add copyright headers to our source code, which is licensed under a GPL license to keep the source as well as any future work in the community. And the Creative Commons licenses are a good way to share our documentation and it is also well accepted by publishers. Therefore this document is licensed to you under a CC-BY-SA license.

To express our desire for a proper attribution we decided to make this a visible part of the license.
To that end we have exercised the rights of section 7 of GPL version 3 and have amended the license terms with an additional paragraph that expresses our wish that if an author has benefited from this code
that he/she should consider giving back a citation as specified on \url{alf.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de}.
This is not something that is meant to restrict your freedom of use, but something that we strongly expect to be good scientific conduct.
The original GPL license can be found in the file \texttt{license.GPL} and the additional terms can be found in \texttt{license.additional}.
In favour to our users, the ALF code contains part of the Lapack implementation version 3.6.1 from \url{http://www.netlib.org/lapack}.
Lapack is licensed under the modified BSD license whose full text can be found in \texttt{license.BSD}.\\
With that being said, we hope that the ALF code will prove to you to be a suitable and high-performance tool that enables
you to perform quantum Monte Carlo studies of solid state models of unprecedented complexity.\\
