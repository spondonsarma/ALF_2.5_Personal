\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
 \mycomment{placeholder for a general introduction, mentioning the purpose and the powers of the general QMC code.}
This documentation is organized as follows. The general Hamiltonian operator is written down in Sec.~\ref{sec:def}, followed by 
a brief outline  of the quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. 
In Sec.~\ref{sec:imp}, we discuss the implementation of a model, introducing the \texttt{Operator} data structure which is the building block of the Hamiltonian. And we disuss the implementation of the lattice and the observables.
Section ~\ref{sec:io} is about actually running the code. We describe input and output files, the analysis protocoll and the compilation procedure. 
In Sec.~\ref{sec:walk1} and \ref{sec:walk2} two detailed walkthroughs are performed: the $SU(2)$-symmetric Hubbard  on a square lattice (Sec.~\ref{sec:walk1}) and the same model, but additionally coupled to a transverse field Ising model (Sec.~\ref{sec:walk2}).
