%\section{Implementation of a model Hamiltonian} 
%To implement a Hamiltonian which belongs to the class of Hamiltonians defined by Eq.~(\ref{eqn_general_ham2}), 
%the user only has to write/modify a single subroutine. A template  will be  given by \texttt{Hamiltonian\_template.f90}. 
%Existing model subroutines are \texttt{Hamiltonian\_Hubb.f90}.
