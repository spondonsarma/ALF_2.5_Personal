In its present form, the  auxiliary field QMC code of the ALF project  allows to simulate a large class of non-trivial models, both efficiently and at minimal  programming cost.  There are many possible extensions which deserve to be considered in future releases.    The model Hamiltonians we have presented so far are imaginary-time independent. This however can be easily generalized  to imaginary-time dependent model Hamiltonians thus allowing, for example, to access  entanglement properties of interacting fermionic systems \cite{Broecker14,Assaad14,Assaad13a,Assaad15}. Generalizations to include global moves are equally desirable. This is a prerequisite to  play with recent ideas of self-learning algorithms  \cite{Xu16a} so as to  possibly avoid the issue of critical slowing down.  At present, the QMC code of this package is  restricted to discrete HS fields such that  implementations  of  the long-range Coulomb repulsion -- as introduced in \cite{Hohenadler14,Ulybyshev2013,Brower12} -- are not yet included.   Extensions  to  continuous HS fields are certainly possible, but require an efficient upgrading scheme. Finally,  an implementation of the  ground state projective QMC method   is equally desirable.
