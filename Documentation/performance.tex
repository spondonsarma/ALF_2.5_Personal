\subsection{Performance}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next to the entire computational time is spent in BLAS routines such that the performance of the code will depend on the  implementation of this library. We have found that the code performs well, and that  an efficient  OpenMP  version  can be obtained merely by   loading the corresponding BLAS and LAPACK routines.
