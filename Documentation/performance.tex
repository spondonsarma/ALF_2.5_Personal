\subsection{Performance}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next to the entire computational time is spent in BLAS routines such that the performance of the code will depend on the particular  implementation of this library. 
We have found that the code performs well, and that  an efficient  OpenMP  version of the library  can be obtained merely by   loading the corresponding BLAS and LAPACK routines. 
\mycomment{MB: Do we want to say more about OpenMP here, i.e. that it can be useful when warm-up time is a problem (and getting many CPUs is not). 
In all other cases, the MPI parallelization is always better than the trivial OpenMP parallelization of library algos.}
