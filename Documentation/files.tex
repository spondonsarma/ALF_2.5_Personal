   \caption{Overview of the standard output files. 
  See Sec.~\ref{sec:obs} for the definitions of observables and correlation functions. \label{table:output}}
\end{table}
%
The standard output files are listed in Table~\ref{table:output}. 
The output of the measured data is organized in bins. One bin corresponds to the arithmetic average 
over a fixed number of individual measurements which depends 
on the chosen measurement interval \path{[LOBS_ST,LOBS_EN]} on the imaginary-time axis and on the number \path{NSweep} of Monte Carlo sweeps. If the user runs a MPI parallelized version of the code, the average also extends 
over the number of MPI threads. The formatting of the output for a single bin depends on the observable type,  \path{Obs_vec} or \path{Obs_Latt}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Observables of type \path{Obs_vec}:
For each additional bin, a single new line is added to the output file.
In case of an observable with \path{N_size} components, the formatting is 
\begin{verbatim}
N_size + 1    <measured value, 1> ... <measured value, N_size>    <measured sign>
\end{verbatim}
The counter variable \path{N_size+1} refers to the number of measurements per line, including the phase measurement. 
This format is required by the error analysis routine (see Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis}). 
Scalar observables like kinetic energy, potential energy, total energy and particle number are treated as a vector 
of size \path{N_size=1}.

\item Observables of type \path{Obs_Latt}:
For each additional bin, a new data block is added to the output file. 
The block consists of the expectation values [Eq.~(\ref{eqn:o})] contributing to the background part [Eq.~(\ref{eqn:s_back})] of the correlation function,
and the correlated part [Eq.~(\ref{eqn:s_corr})] of the correlation function.
For imaginary-time displaced correlation functions, the formatting of the block follows this scheme:
\begin{alltt}
<measured sign>  <N_orbital>  <N_unit_cell> <N_time_slices> <dtau>
do alpha = 1, N_orbital
    \(\langle\hat{O}\sb{\alpha}\rangle \)
enddo
do i = 1, N_unit_cell
   <reciprocal lattice vector k(i)>
   do tau = 1, N_time_slices
      do alpha = 1, N_orbital
         do beta = 1, N_orbital
            \(\langle\,S\sb{\alpha,\beta}\sp{(corr)}(k(i),\tau)\rangle\)
         enddo
      enddo
   enddo
enddo
\end{alltt}
The same block structure is used for equal time correlation functions, except for the entries  \path{<N_time_slices>} and \path{<dtau>} 
which are not present in the latter.
Using this structure for the bins as input,
the full correlation function $S_{\alpha,\beta}(\vec{k},\tau)$ [Eq.~(\ref{eqn:s})] is then calculated by calling the error analysis routine (see Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis})
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Output: Precision} \label{sec:output_prec}
%------------------------------------------------------------
%
The finite temperature  auxiliary field QMC algorithm is known to be numerically  unstable, as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:stable}.
The origin the numerical instabilities arises  from the imaginary-time propagation which invariably leads to exponentially small and exponentially large scales.
Numerical stabilization of the code is delicate and has been pioneered in Ref.~\cite{White89}  for the finite-temperature algorithm and in Refs.~\cite{Sugiyama86,Sorella89} for the zero temperature projective algorithm.
As shown in Ref.~\cite{Assaad08_rev}  scales can be omitted in the ground state algorithm -- thus rendering it very stable --  but have to be taken into account in the  finite-temperature code. Apart from runtime information, the file \texttt{info} contains important information concerning the stability of the code.
It is important to know that numerical stabilization is delicate and there is no guarantee  that it will work for all models.




If the numerical stabilization turns out to be bad, one option is to reduce the  value of the parameter \texttt{Nwrap} in the parameter file. 
For performing the stabilization of the involved matrix multiplications we rely on routines from lapack. Hence it is very likely that your results may change significantly if the you switch libraries.
In order to offer a simple baseline to which people can quickly switch if they want to see whether their results depend on the library used for linear algebra routines we have included parts of the lapack-3.6.1 reference implementation from
\url{http://www.netlib.org/lapack/}. You can switch to the QR decomposition related routines from the lapack reference implementation by including the switch \texttt{-DQRREF} into their PROGRAMMCONFIGURATION string.
To use these routines you need to link against a lapack library that implements at least the lapack-3.4.0 interface. \footnote{ We have encountered some compiling issues with this flag. In particular  the  older  intel  ifort  compiler version 10.1  fails for all optimization levels.} 

To provide further flexibility, we have  kept the history of different stabilization schemes.   Our default strategy is quick and generically works well but we have  encountered some  models where  it  fails.   If this applies to your model, you can use the switch \texttt{-DSTAB2}   or  \texttt{-DSTAB1}  in the \texttt{set\_env.sh}  file and recompile the code.  

Typical values for the numerical precision can be found in the examples of Sec.~\ref{sec:ex} (see Sec.~\ref{sec:prec_charge} and \ref{sec:prec_spin}).
