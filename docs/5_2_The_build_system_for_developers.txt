# The structure of the build system #

## Libraries ##
Currently the project consists of four Libraries and essentially one executable.
Each of the Libraries has its own CMakeLists.txt which captures the files that
make up a library. If you add or remove a file of a library you have to that here.
If you want to add a new library It should also bring its own CMakeLists.txt.

## Executable ##
In the executable's directory we find a CMakeLists.txt that defines the relation between the source file and the Libraries.
The system is made, so that different Models can be easily added.
First we define files that are common to all models via the variable Common_src.
Next comes a FOREACH loop that iterates over the various models.
The models are given as arguments of the FOREACH loop.
Currently we have Hub and SPT. This FOREACH construct works 
due to the ASSUMPTION that a new model is defined via a file Hamiltonian_${MODELTYPE}.f90 .

So if you want to add a new model you have to write a new file Hamiltonian_MyModel.f90
and add MyModel to the FOREACH loop

For each model a new make target is generated.

## toplevel CMakeLists.txt ##
In the top level Makefile the differen constituents of the project are defined.
The Variable PROGEXE contains the name of the executable (currently qmct).
Next we define which Libraries belong to the project.
So if you want to add a new library you also have to da that here.
