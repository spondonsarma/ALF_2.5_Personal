1)    Implemented  optimizations made by Johannes.  The code is thereby not necessarily faster !  You  may want to  try the code with the sameoriginal routines upgrade_FFA.f90  Operator_FFA.f90

2)    In the file parameter you can read a variable  CPU_MAX = 0.1 in the namespace &VAR_QMC. If present the code will stop after  the given time. i.e. will  carry out the number of bins you request.  If not present the code will just rect as usual and carry out the requested number of bins. (Implemented by Martin  Bercx). 

3)    In this version,  NWRAP does not have to be a multiple of Ltrot.  This greatly facilitates temperature scans. 

4)    I have included the Condo model on the honeycomb lattice with z-frustrating interactions.
