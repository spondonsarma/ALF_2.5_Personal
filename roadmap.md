Main points from March meetings:

* Adopt half-yearly **releases**: **1st April and 1st October**;
* Have a new documentation paper about every three years. The next one should be online by June 2020.
* Next ALF release (April 2020) will be called ALF 2.0 (instead of 1.2).


ALF 2.0
---

- Parallel tempering
- Global updates / global tau
- Projective approaches
- Continuous fields
- Langevin
- Maxent
- More models
- Trotter symmetric
- Predefined structures.
The last two still need some work from Fakher, and Langevin has to be merged in, but then the code will be essentially ready for release and we only have to worry about the documentation (paper).

ALF 3.0
---

We intend to have:
- Improved overall usability
- Improved I.O., HDF5
- Improved post-processing
- Implementation with classes
- Trotter options
- Time-dependent Hamiltonians
- Hybrid Monte Carlo with exact forces
- RÃ©nyi entropies
- Interaction expansion (CT-INT).
