;; This buffer is for text that is not saved, and for Lisp evaluation.
;; To create a file, visit it with C-x C-f and enter text in its buffer.

If \texttt{N_FL=2} and \texttt{N_SUN=1}, then the routine returns:

\begin{align}
\texttt{ObsZ}   &=  4 * <c^{dag}_i S^z c_i  c^{dag}_j S^z  c_j>   
\texttt{ObsXY}  &=  2 ( <c^{dag}_i S^x c_i  c^{dag}_j S^x  c_j> +   <c^{dag}_i S^y c_i  c^{dag}_j S^y  c_j>)
\texttt{ObsXYZ} &=  (2 ObsXY + ObsZ)/3
\end{align}
